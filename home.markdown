I am a geomorphologist using theory, numerical modelling, emerging high resolution data sets and field observations to understand surface processes across environments. My work aims to develop theory that describes physical processes in meaningful ways that maximizes information from new high resolution data sets. I am a postdoctoral research scientist with the United States Geological Survey in Moffett Field, CA.

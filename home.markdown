I am a geomorphologist who combines quantitative and probabilistic methods with field data to understand the processes that shape Earthâ€™s surface. My work informs how land surfaces encode
weather, ecology, and land-use, and uncovers the physical processes that lead to land surface evolution. Today, Earth scientists have access to unprecedented data in terms of coverage and
resolution, and my research develops probabilistic and mathematical theory that takes full advantage of emerging data sets. In contrast to classic deterministic models that rely on averaged values, my approach embraces the variability of natural systems to reveal new information about processes. As society continues to face new challenges from climate change, and as our field continues to collect more and higher resolution data, such process-based approaches are critical for understanding our changing world. I am a postdoctoral research scientist at Indiana University Bloomington.

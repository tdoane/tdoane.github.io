I recently taught the Geomorphology course at UC Berkeley. This is an upper level surface process course that discusses glacial, hillslope, and fluvial processes. Three different field trips accompany each section and a major class project. I taught this course in the fall of 2021 when the delta variant of Covid-19 was on the rise and the Dixie Fire in the Sierra Nevada forced us to adapt a field trip to an online one. While the field experience would have been great for the students, developing a virtual version is a valuable exericse and is important to have in place for the future.
